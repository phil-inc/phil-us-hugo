In addition, Phil may contact you to provide information about treatment alternatives or other health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you.

<u>Payment</u>: Phil may use and disclose your PHI to obtain payment for equipment and services provided to you. For example, Phil may use and disclose PHI to claim and obtain payment from your health insurer, HMO, or other company that arranges or pays the cost of some or all of your healthcare (“Payors”), to verify that Payors will pay for healthcare rendered or for eligibility inquiries.

<u>Health Care Operations</u>: Phil may use and disclose your PHI in performing a variety of business activities referred to as “health care operations.” These activities allow Phil to improve the quality of care provided and reduce healthcare costs. For example, Phil may use PHI to evaluate the competence of its pharmacists and other healthcare workers and to arrange for legal services. Phil may also disclose PHI to other entities covered by HIPAA to conduct certain health care operations, such as quality assessment and improvement activities, or for healthcare fraud and abuse detection or compliance. We may also make incidental disclosures of limited PHI tothe extent permitted by law.

<u>Disclosure to Relatives, Close Friends and Other Caregivers</u>: Phil may use or disclose your PHI to a family member, other relative, a close personal friend or any other person identified by you when you are present for, or otherwise available prior to, the disclosure, if (1) Phil obtains your agreement; or (2) you do not object to the disclosure. If you are not present, or the opportunity to agree or object to a use or disclosure cannot practicably be provided because of your incapacity or an emergency circumstance, Phil may exercise professional judgment to determine whether a disclosure is in your best interests. If Phil discloses information to a family member, caregiver, other relative or a close personal friend, Phil would disclose only information that it believes is directly relevant to the person’s involvement with your healthcare or payment related to your healthcare. Phil may also disclose your PHI in order to notify (or assist in notifying) such persons of your location, general condition or death. If the patient is a minor, Phil may disclose PHI about the minor to a parent, guardian or other person responsible for the minor except in limited circumstances.
