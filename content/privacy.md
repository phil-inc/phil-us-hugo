# Privacy Policy

#### Last updated on January 09, 2020


Protecting your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive through our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms of Service.


## Revisions to this Privacy Policy

Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or through other communications to you, and we'll update the “Last Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective.



## Collection and Use of Information

### **Information Collected or Received from You**

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.

<u>Account Information</u>. If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you personally identifiable information (“PII”), such as your name, and email address, and if you elect to use our prescription delivery services, we will collect the full name of the patient, phone number, current prescription number, photo of insurance card (if applicable), credit card information and postal address. We may also collect certain medical information such as your physician’s and current pharmacy’s names, phone numbers and addresses, information about the prescription medication, and medical history such as allergies. We may also collect certain information such as your zip code, date of birth and other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.

<u>Information Collected Using Analytics Software. Like many web application operators, we use automated data collection tools such as certain analytics software to collect information related to your use of the Services. Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences.

Web Beacons (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages or in an e-mail.

<u>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device. We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.

<u>Use of Your Information. We use your PII to respond to your requests, such as to fulfill your order, contact you with information about your order, send you email alerts, send you newsletters, and to provide you with related customer service. We may also use your information to send marketing communications and administrative information to you, including through the use of push notifications in our app. We may use PII to personalize your experience on the Services and for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, and developing our Services.

<u>Use of Non Personal Informationn. We may use and disclose information that does not personally identify you (including information identified in this section that is not otherwise referenced as PII ) for any purpose, except to the extent limited by applicable law. If we are required to treat such information as PII under applicable law, then we may use it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose PII.

<u>Combined Use of PII and Non Personal Information. We may combine information that does not personally identify you with PII. If we do, we will treat the combined information as PII as long as it is combined.



## Information that We Share with Third Parties

We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:

<u>Information Shared with Our Services Providers. We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.

<u>Information Shared with Pharmacies. In order to fulfill your Order and deliver your prescription, we will transfer certain information to a Pharmacy, such as your prescription by a doctor, your PII and person health information. If the Pharmacy initially chosen by the Services is unable to fill your prescription, we may transfer your personal information to another Pharmacy that will process and fill your prescription.

<u>Information Shared with Third Parties. We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes. We may also share your Personal Information - as permitted or allowed by law - to contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.

<u>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions. Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.

<u>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.



## Your Choices

We offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your PII and we’ll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide not to provide us with the PII that we request, you may not be able to access all of the features of the Services.

<u>Opt-Out. We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote our Services. When you receive such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” (either through your Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive). We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy or information about billing.

<u>Modifying Your Information. You can access and modify the information you provided through your Account. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at{' '} [hello@phil.us](mailto:hello@phil.us) {' '} with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon we can, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.



## The Security of Your Information

We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII and personal health information) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt this data using SSL or other technologies. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.

Phil hereby disclaims any and all liability for any type of damages including, but not limited to, indirect, incidental, consequential or special damages, or losses of expenses, for the actions and customer information practices of any of the participating Pharmacies.



## Phishing Warning

"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from Phil asking for your personal information, you should not respond. We will never request your password, username, or other personal information through a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication through e-mail.



## Links to Other Sites

Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a “Third-party Service”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.



## Our Policy Toward Children

Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII directly from children under 13\. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may collect PII about children under 13 that parents or guardians provide to us when ordering prescriptions for their children.



## Your Obligations

By establishing a phil.us account, you agree that it is your responsibility to authorize, monitor and control access to and use of your phil.us account, User ID and password. We recommend that you use a password that contains both letters, numbers, capitalization and/or symbols. You should also periodically change your password. By using our Services, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks. If you believe that your phil.us account or any information you provided to us is no longer secure, please notify us immediately through the contact information provided below.



## Your Privacy Rights

We do not use your PII for direct marketing purposes. Yet, under California law (California Civil Code sections 1798.83, 1798.84) or other state laws applicable to the state you are a resident of, you are entitled to request a copy of all PII disclosed for direct marketing purposes.
