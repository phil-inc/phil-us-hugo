            Permissible Uses and Disclosures Without Your Written Authorization
        </h2>
        <p class="hipaa-page__paragraph">
            This section discusses how PHI may be used or disclosed without an
            authorization. Not every use or disclosure in a category will be
            listed. Your PHI may be stored in paper, electronic or other form
            and may be disclosed electronically and by other methods.
        </p>
        <p class="hipaa-page__paragraph">
            <span class="underline">Treatment</span>: Phil use and disclose your
            PHI to provide treatment to you. For example, Phil may use and
            disclose your PHI to fill prescriptions and coordinate care with
            other providers involved in your treatment. In addition, Phil may
            contact you to provide information about treatment alternatives or
            other health-related benefits and services that may be of interest
            to you.
        </p>
        <p class="hipaa-page__paragraph">
            <span class="underline">Payment</span>: Phil may use and disclose
            your PHI to obtain payment for equipment and services provided to
            you. For example, Phil may use and disclose PHI to claim and obtain
            payment from your health insurer, HMO, or other company that
            arranges or pays the cost of some or all of your healthcare
            (“Payors”), to verify that Payors will pay for healthcare rendered
            or for eligibility inquiries.
        </p>
        <p class="hipaa-page__paragraph">
            <span class="underline">Health Care Operations</span>: Phil may use
            and disclose your PHI in performing a variety of business activities
            referred to as “health care operations.” These activities allow Phil
            to improve the quality of care provided and reduce healthcare costs.
            For example, Phil may use PHI to evaluate the competence of its
            pharmacists and other healthcare workers and to arrange for legal
            services. Phil may also disclose PHI to other entities covered by
            HIPAA to conduct certain health care operations, such as quality
            assessment and improvement activities, or for healthcare fraud and
            abuse detection or compliance. We may also make incidental
            disclosures of limited PHI tothe extent permitted by law.
        </p>
        <p class="hipaa-page__paragraph">
            <span class="underline">Disclosure to Relatives, Close Friends and Other Caregivers</span>: Phil may use
            or disclose your PHI to a family member, other
            relative, a close personal friend or any other person identified by
            you when you are present for, or otherwise available prior to, the
            disclosure, if (1) Phil obtains your agreement; or (2) you do not
            object to the disclosure. If you are not present, or the opportunity
            to agree or object to a use or disclosure cannot practicably be
            provided because of your incapacity or an emergency circumstance,
            Phil may exercise professional judgment to determine whether a
            disclosure is in your best interests. If Phil discloses information
            to a family member, caregiver, other relative or a close personal
            friend, Phil would disclose only information that it believes is
            directly relevant to the person’s involvement with your healthcare
            or payment related to your healthcare. Phil may also disclose your
            PHI in order to notify (or assist in notifying) such persons of your
            location, general condition or death. If the patient is a minor,
            Phil may disclose PHI about the minor to a parent, guardian or other
            person responsible for the minor except in limited circumstances.
        </p>
        <p class="hipaa-page__paragraph">
            <span class="underline">As Required by Law</span>: Phil will use and
            disclose your PHI whenever required by law. For example, Phil is

            Services if requested to determine HIPAA compliance.

            injury or disability or aiding in disaster relief; (2) to report
            child abuse and neglect to public health authorities or other
            government authorities authorized by law to receive such reports;
