# Terms of Use

#### Last updated on March 2, 2021

Welcome to Phil, an online prescription management and delivery
platform (the “Services”) made available by Phil, Inc. (“Phil,” “we,”
“us” or “our”). You can access the Services through our web
application, text messaging and email communications. Please read
these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) carefully because they serve as
an agreement between you and Phil. If you do not agree to these Terms
or are younger than eighteen (18) years old, do not use the Services.

By accessing or using the Services in any way, including without
limitation, browsing the Services, using any information, or
submitting any content or personal information via the Services, you
agree to and are bound by the terms, conditions, policies, and notices
contained in these Terms, including conducting this transaction
electronically, certain third-party terms and conditions, disclaimers
of warranties, damage and remedy exclusions and limitations, binding
arbitration, venue selection, and a choice of California law. You
represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years old
and possess the legal right to agree to these terms.

## Phil is a Prescription Management Platform

Phil enables you to place an order for one (1) or more of your
prescription medication needs (“Order“) and acts as a prescription
management platform only. Each medication that you order through
Phil must be based on a valid prescription issued for a legitimate
medical purpose by a medical professional acting in the usual course
of his/her professional practice. The Services are not intended to
be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or
treatment, and do not constitute medical or other professional
advice. Phil does not recommend or endorse any specific tests,
physicians, products, procedures, opinions, or other information
that may be mentioned on the Services or by any other electronic
means. Reliance on any information provided by Phil is solely at
your own risk. The information provided through Phil’s Services is
designed to support, not replace, the relationship that exists
between patient/site-visitor and his/her physician. Never disregard
professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of
something you have read or seen on our Services.

## Order Fulfillment by Pharmacy

When you place an Order through Phil, we work with a pharmacy that
processes your Order and fills your prescriptions (each, a
“Pharmacy”). You acknowledge and agree that Phil is not a pharmacy
and that we don’t fill prescriptions ourselves, nor do we
manufacture, prepare, dispense or provide medications of any kind.
You also acknowledge and agree that, although we may select certain
pharmacies to work with based on various metrics we apply, our
decision to work with a specific pharmacy should not be deemed as an
endorsement of, or a warranty regarding the quality of services
provided by, such pharmacy. If, for any reason, you aren’t satisfied
with the manner in which a Pharmacy processed your Order, you agree
to address this issue with the Pharmacy directly.

You also acknowledge and agree that we do not provide any medical
advice, opinion, diagnosis or treatment, and that that no
pharmacy-patient relationship or doctor-patient relationship is, or
will be, established between Phil and you as a result of your use of
the Services or otherwise. You should check product information
(including package inserts) regarding dosages, precautions,
warnings, interactions and contraindications before administering or
using any medications. If you have any questions regarding your
prescriptions, you should consult your healthcare professional or
pharmacist, whose contact information may be listed on the
prescription, the packaging of your prescription medicine or under
your Account.

### IF YOU ARE HAVING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, DO NOT USE OUR SERVICES – CALL 911.

## Authorization to Transfer Prescription

If your prescription was transferred to or originally filled by a
non-participating pharmacy (not within Phil’s network) Phil may
facilitate the transfer of your prescription to its participating
pharmacy. By using Phil’s services, you authorize Phil to facilitate
the transfer of your prescription to any participating pharmacy.
Phil has the sole discretion to determine which participating
pharmacy fills your prescription. Additionally, in order to provide
you the best possible quality of service, you authorize Phil to
facilitate the transfer of your prescription from one Phil partner
pharmacy to another.

## Agreement to Terms

By using our Services, you expressly acknowledge and agree to the
following terms:

1. Phil may use the personal information you provide via the Services
   to process your Order and fill your prescription(s). If the
   Pharmacy initially chosen by the Services is unable to fill your
   prescription(s), you expressly agree that Phil may transfer your
   personal information to another Pharmacy to do so.

2. Phil may use your email to communicate with you regarding
   services, billing, and advertising. You understand that email
   communication has risk of third-party interception and maybe
   transmitted to unintended parties. You expressly agree to hold
   Phil harmless for any damages associated with the security breach
   of your email or erroneous transmission.

3. Phil may apply manufacturers’ financial assistance, such as
   coupons, discounts, repayment, and other reductions in your
   out-of-pocket expenses in compliance with state and federal laws
   and regulations applicable to drug manufacturers&apos; assistance.
   Please note that manufacturers&apos; financial assistance is not
   available for government-sponsored plans, such as Medicare or
   Medicaid.

## Privacy Policy

Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy)for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users. By using our Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
We verify that each Pharmacy that we work with is a licensed
pharmacy and we enter into a Business Associate Agreement with each
such Pharmacy to protect your personal information.

## Changes to Terms or Services

We may change, modify, add, and/or delete all or portions of these
Terms from time to time. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by
posting the modified Terms on the web application or through other
communications to you. It’s important that you review the modified
Terms, because your continued use of the Services after we’ve let
you know that the Terms have been modified indicates and constitutes
your acceptance of the modified Terms. If you don’t want to be bound
by the modified Terms, your only recourse is to discontinue use the
Services. We’re always striving to improve the Services and, because
our Services are evolving over time, we may change or discontinue
all or any part of the Services. These changes may happen at any
time and without notice.

## Health-Related Content

The health-related content you may find in the Services
(“Health-related Content”) is broad in nature and in scope,
describes only general principles of health care, and is neither
specific instructions for individual patients nor appropriate or
relevant to your personal situation. Health-related Content is not
intended to be used to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent diseases or
as a self-medication guide or substitute for consulting with your

partners and service providers to use autodialer and non-autodialer
technology to send text messages to the mobile phone number
associated with your opt-in (i.e., the number listed in your

## Additional Users of the Services
You may add your family members, or others you are authorized to
represent, as users of the Services on the following conditions:

By adding a user over the age of eighteen (18) you acknowledge that
you are acting as this user&apos;s representative and have an
express authorization from the patient to enter his/her personal
information and have medications delivered to the address entered.

If the additional user is under the age of eighteen (18) (a “Minor
Child”), you acknowledge that you are a parent or a guardian of the
user. You recognize and acknowledge that there are certain risks of
physical injury in connection with the administering of medication
to a Minor Child. Such risks include, but are not limited to,
failing to properly administer the medication, failing to observe
side effects, failing to assess and/or recognize an adverse
reaction, failing to assess and/or recognize a medical emergency,
and failing to recognize the need to summon emergency medical
services. You hereby fully release or discharge Phil and dispensing
pharmacy from any and all claims from injuries, damages and losses
your Minor Child may have, arising out of, connected with,
incidental to, or in any way associated with the administering of
medication.

## Delivery of Your Order
If no one is present at your delivery address at the time of the
delivery to receive your Order, the courier may leave your Order at
your door or other secure location in accordance with the general
guidelines issued by the delivery services, if the courier believes
it is reasonable to do so.

## Feedback to the Phil Services

Your opinion matters to us! We welcome feedback, comments and
suggestions for improvements to the Services (“Feedback”). You can
submit Feedback by emailing us at <hello@phil.us>. If you provide us any Feedback, you agree that we may use the Feedback you provide to us in any way, including in future
modifications to the Services or in other services we may provide.
You hereby grant to Phil a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable,
fully-paid, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable license to
use, copy, modify, distribute, display, create derivative works of
and otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose.

## Payment for Your Order through Phil
        
When you submit an Order through Phil, the Pharmacy selected by the
Services will calculate the total Order price, which will be based
on: (i) the actual cash price charged by the Pharmacy for each
medication, if you do not have health insurance coverage for
prescription medications; (ii) a copay amount that you are required
to pay for medications, if you do have health insurance coverage for
prescription medications; and (iii) any applicable delivery and
handling fee that we may charge for delivery of the medication to
the address specified in your Order. After the Pharmacy determines
the total Order price, we will send you an email to notify you of
the Order Price. We will charge you only when you confirm the Order
(using the appropriate button in the Service). For recurring Orders
for medications that you take on an ongoing basis, if there is no
change in the price or copay amount for the recurring Orders, we
will process such Orders and charge you for the same price without
sending you additional email for confirmation. If the price for a
recurring Order has increased, we will send you another email to
confirm the higher price or copay amount. If the price or copay
amount for a recurring Order has decreased, we will charge you the
lower price or copay amount without explicitly notifying you of the
decrease.


If you place an Order via the Services, you agree (i) that Phil or
Phil’s third party payment processing service provider may process
and/or charge your credit card (and on a recurring basis for
recurring medications) for verification, pre-authorization and
payment purposes; (ii) to bear any additional charges that your bank
or other financial service provider may levy on you as well as any
fees or taxes that may apply to you, and (iii) that Phil may use
your insurance information to run a test claim to determine the
price of the medication and whether a Prior Authorization is needed.
You’ll receive a confirmation by email once the Pharmacy has
completed processing your Order. If you have any concerns or
objections regarding any charges, you agree to raise them first with
Phil and you agree not to cancel or reject any credit card charges
unless you have made a reasonable attempt at resolving the matter
directly with Phil or the Pharmacy.


By pressing the “Approve” button for the listed charges in the
Service, you agree to submit the amount listed for payment on your
credit card and consent to the storage of your credit card
information. You certify that you are an authorized user of this
credit card and that you will not dispute the payment with the
credit card company so long as the transaction corresponds to the
terms indicated on the payment page and in the Terms. You
acknowledge that if any charges to the credit card are declined or
charge backs are claimed against any outstanding amount, you will
still be liable for payment pursuant to the Terms.

## No Refunds
It is important that you carefully review any order or renewal for
recurring prescriptions that you place. Once the medication has been
shipped it cannot be returned and we offer no refund.
        
       
## Cancellation of Your Prescription or Refill
       
You may remove a prescription from your Account or cancel a refill
for a particular prescription at any time through the Services
before an Order is placed for that prescription.

We have the right to investigate violations of these Terms or conduct that affects the Services. We may also consult and cooperate with law enforcement authorities to prosecute users who violate the law.

## Links to Third Party Websites or Resources

The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources (“Linked Sites”). We provide these links only as a convenience and are not responsible for the content, products or services on or available from those websites or resources or links displayed on such sites.

You should refer to the separate terms of use, privacy policies, and other rules posted on Linked Sites before you use them. Phil does not author, edit or monitor these Linked Sites, and is not responsible or liable for: (a) the availability of or content provided on such Linked Sites, nor does inclusion of any link imply endorsement of the Linked Sites by Phil, or vice versa; (b) third-party content accessible through such Linked Sites; (c) any loss or damage whatsoever you may incur from dealing with any Linked Site; or (d) your dealings with any third parties found on or through this Site. You bear all risk associated with the use of the Linked Sites, third party services, and your correspondence or business dealings with advertisers other than us found on or through the Services.

Phil does not control, makes no guarantees about, and disclaims any express or implied representations or warranties about the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, completeness, or appropriateness for a particular purpose of the information or the resources contained on the Linked Sites or any other Internet sites. We reserve the right to terminate such links at any time. The fact that we offer such links should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or sponsorship of that site or its content, products, or services.

## Electronic Communications

When you send emails or other electronic messages to us or in connection with the Services, you are communicating with us electronically and consent to our review and analysis of such messages and to receive return communications, if any, from us electronically. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically shall have the same legal effect as if provided physically and shall satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

## Mobile Security

Most communication with Phil occurs through your mobile device. Therefore your mobile device likely contains Protected Health Information (“PHI”), such as pictures of your prescriptions, medical insurance cards, and other vulnerable information. As a result, it is of utmost importance that you keep your mobile devices secure at all times. If you are using public Wi-Fi or email applications on mobile devices, you are likely using unsecure mobile networks, putting PHI at risk of interception.

The best ways to protect mobile devices from security breaches is to maintain password protection, encryption, and/or to install a remote wiping/disabling program into them. A remote wiping/disabling program allows users to quickly clear and disable a lost or stolen mobile device, which can possibly prevent or reduce the magnitude of the breach.

While Phil is HIPAA compliant and takes the utmost care in protecting your confidential information, it cannot protect information stored in your mobile device. By using Phil, you agree to hold Phil harmless of any data breaches occurring from theft/misplacement or any third-party intervention with your mobile device.

## Termination

We may terminate your access to and use of the Services or deactivate or cancel your Account, at our sole discretion with or without notice, temporarily or permanently, for any reason or no reason, and without liability to you. You may cancel your Account at any time by sending an email to us at <hello@phil.us>. Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of Services or your Account, all provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive will survive, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution provisions. Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of the Services or your Account by you or us, you will continue to be obligated to pay all amounts owing under these Terms which are due and payable prior to such termination, discontinuation or cancellation.

## Warranty Disclaimers

To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, the Services are provided “AS IS, WHERE IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting the foregoing, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, SECURITY, ACCURACY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. PHIL EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF ANY ACTION TAKEN IN RELIANCE ON THE SERVICES AND/OR ANY CONTENT, TOOLS, APPLICATIONS, AND PRODUCTS PROVIDED ON THE SERVICES.

IT IS SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO (1) ENSURE THAT YOUR ORDER WAS PROPERLY PROCESSED AND THAT YOU RECEIVED THE CORRECT MEDICATIONS (INCLUDING THE CORRECT DOSAGE(S) THEREOF), (2) CONSUME THE PROPER DOSAGE(S) OF YOUR MEDICATION(S), AND (3) STORE ALL MEDICATIONS PROPERLY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDELINES PROVIDED BY THE PHARMACY AND/OR APPLICABLE MEDICATION MANUFACTURER(S).

PHIL EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING A PHARMACY’S AND ITS PERSONNEL’S PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERTISE, QUALITY OF WORK, OR ACCURACY IN FILLING YOUR PRESCRIPTION(S), AND ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR A PHARMACY’S COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, PHIL EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY PRESCRIPTIONS INCORRECTLY FILLED BY A PHARMACY, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF INACCURATE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU OR OTHERWISE, ANY CANCELLED OR OTHERWISE UNFILLED PRESCRIPTIONS (OR ANY INJURY OR DEATH RESULTING THEREFROM), OR ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF ANY PHARMACY.

## Indemnity

You will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Phil and its officers, directors, employee and agents, from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the Services, or (ii) your violation of these Terms.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

IN NO EVENT WILL PHIL’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY HEALTH-RELATED CONTENT, OR FROM ANY COMMUNICATIONS OR INTERACTIONS WITH ANY PHARMACIES, EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO PHIL FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE TERMS, AS APPLICABLE. PHIL AND ITS AUTHORIZED AGENTS AND CONTRACTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR INJURY ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, FROM THEIR ACTS OR OMISSIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IN PROCURING, COMPILING OR DELIVERING ANY MEDICATIONS (OR ANY RELATED INFORMATION) TO YOU.

Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Phil will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.

### Fees

Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000), Phil will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

### Changes

Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to Terms or Services” section above, if Phil changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <hello@phil.us>) within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Phil’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Phil in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

## General Terms

These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Phil and you regarding the Services and Orders, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Phil and you regarding the Services and Orders. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the “Arbitration” section above or by court of competent jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Phil’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without Phil’s consent, will be null and of no effect. Phil may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

Any notices or other communications provided by Phil under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given by Phil: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. These Terms apply only to Phil and you. These Terms are not intended to, and shall not, create any third-party beneficiary rights, except as expressly provided in these Terms.

Phil’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Phil. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
