            fundraise led by Warburg Pincus, a leading global growth investor.
            The investment is part of an arrangement for Warburg Pincus to
            invest up to $100 million and enables Phil to accelerate the
            development of innovative products while continuing to support the

            will join the company’s board of directors. Fred has a multi-decade
            career in pharmaceuticals, including roles as CEO of Schering-Plough

            Specialty pharmaceutical products treat complex health conditions
            and constitute a significant portion of U.S. prescription medication
            spend. Despite the therapeutic potential of these products, patients
            and their care teams face substantial obstacles to access,
            affordability, and adherence. While these challenges have been
            traditionally addressed through call-center based ‘hub’ services,
            Phil’s team has developed a next-generation suite of software tools
            to streamline and simplify this complex, distributed workflow
            spanning patients, prescribers, pharmacies, insurers, and
            manufacturers. Phil’s solution drives efficiencies that result in up
            to 6x higher adherence and 33% improvements in patient affordability
            at 1/10th the cost of call-center based approaches, and is able to
            serve a wide range of therapies ranging from specialty ‘lite’
            products to core specialty therapeutics.
          </p>
          <p class="press-release__text">
            “As the only technology-powered, full-suite solution addressing the
            specialty pharmaceuticals market, Phil uniquely provides an
            integrated suite of solutions to replace the historically complex
            and cost-prohibitive process of deploying ‘hub’ services. With the
            goal to become the gold standard for pharmaceutical access,
            affordability, and distribution, this investment enables us to
            accelerate our growth at a rapid pace and serves as a well-deserved
            recognition of our entire team’s commitment over the past 6 years,”
            said Deepak Thomas, Founder and CEO of Phil. “Warburg Pincus has a
            stellar track record of investing and scaling innovative and
            category-defining healthcare and technology companies. Their
            operational and strategic support will be invaluable as we continue
            to grow our platform and relentlessly work to improve the experience
            of our customers and patients.”

          <p class="press-release__text">
            “The increasing demand for cost-effective, technology-enabled
            solutions, paired with the shift towards specialty medications in
            the go-forward pharmaceutical pipeline has enabled Phil to emerge as
            a disruptor in the space, providing a differentiated business model,
            grounded in modern technology,” said Andrew Park, Managing Director,
            Warburg Pincus. “We believe our investment will help advance Phil’s
            technology roadmap and are excited to partner with Deepak and the
            company in its next phase of growth,” added Pranav Verma,
            VicePresident, Warburg Pincus.

            “Phil is well-positioned to help pharmaceutical manufacturers
            address the challenge of efficient prescription management through
            its innovative platform that has been successfully deployed at some
            of the largest pharmaceutical companies across the United States,”
            said Fred Hassan, Director, Warburg Pincus. “I look forward to
