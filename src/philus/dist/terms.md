## Phil is a Prescription Management Platform
Phil enables you to place an order for one (1) or more of your
prescription medication needs (“Order“) and acts as a prescription
management platform only. Each medication that you order through
Phil must be based on a valid prescription issued for a legitimate
medical purpose by a medical professional acting in the usual course
of his/her professional practice. The Services are not intended to
be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or
treatment, and do not constitute medical or other professional
advice. Phil does not recommend or endorse any specific tests,
physicians, products, procedures, opinions, or other information
that may be mentioned on the Services or by any other electronic
means. Reliance on any information provided by Phil is solely at
your own risk. The information provided through Phil’s Services is
designed to support, not replace, the relationship that exists
between patient/site-visitor and his/her physician. Never disregard
professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of
something you have read or seen on our Services.
